# WebHookMock

A powerful and user-friendly webhook testing tool that allows developers to create, manage, and test webhook APIs with ease.

## Overview

WebHookMock is a Spring Boot application designed to simplify webhook development and testing. It provides a seamless way to:

- Create custom API endpoints with configurable responses
- Monitor and log incoming webhook requests in real-time
- Configure various response parameters including status codes, headers, and response bodies
- Add intentional delays to simulate real-world API behavior
- Export request logs for documentation and analysis

## Features

### API Configuration
- Create custom endpoints with personalized paths
- Configure HTTP response status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, etc.)
- Set response content types (JSON, XML, HTML, etc.)
- Customize response headers
- Add response delays to simulate latency

### Request Monitoring
- Real-time logging of all incoming requests
- Detailed view of request headers, body, and parameters
- WebSocket support for live updates
- Export logs to Excel for further analysis

### User Management
- Secure registration and authentication
- User-specific webhook URLs (e.g., `https://domain/api/@username/path`)
- Isolated environments for each user

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot 2.7.9
- **Security**: Spring Security
- **Database**: H2 Database (file-based persistence)
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket (STOMP)
- **Export Functionality**: Apache POI (Excel)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Maven 3.6+ (or use the included Maven wrapper)

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the application using Maven:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Or on Windows:

```bash
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:8081`

### Configuration

The application uses an H2 database by default, with the database file stored in the `./data/mockwebhook` directory. You can modify the configuration in `application.properties`.

## Usage

1. **Register an account**: Create a personal account to get your unique webhook URL
2. **Create API configurations**: Define custom endpoints with your desired response data
3. **Use your webhook**: Send requests to your personalized webhook URL
4. **Monitor requests**: View detailed logs of all incoming requests
5. **Export data**: Export request logs to Excel for further analysis
